        The US before WWII didn’t really have tanks development due to lack luster perforce and 
        instead maintained one the largest cavalry in the world. Even the last US cavalry charge took place 
        in 1942 in the Philippines.

        This was a stop gap tank while the m4 was still in development combining any element might 
        deemed useful into one thing. This Frankenstein monster tank had a much longer production 
        because changing the line to m4 was not considered efficient enough.

      <p>
        The Pershing was the only American heavy tank to see combat as other programs cancelled or 
        never made it to a war, but after WWII the Pershing was redesignated as a medium tank due to 
        changing standers of tanks, the reason that us never field any other heavy tanks is due to lack of 
        proper infrastructure only a handful of train cars and cranes could support the weight. So, when 
        this tanks rolled on to the battlefield it wasn’t just a sign tank development but the industrial 
        capability of the US.

        Bulit during the Korean war The M46 is a modernized M26 with most notably a new 800hp 
        engine. It was also the first American Main Battle tank (MBT), A new class of tank with more

        While made in large quantity to replace the problematic m46, it would never see service in

      <p>
        M48 Patton would be the first us tank to use the current crew lay out Driver in the center 
        hull command seated behind the gunner on the right side and loader on the left with ammo behind 
        him. The m48 was chosen over the m47 due to the turret being wider allowing for more future 
        modification like 105mm L7 cannon that would be on the m60.

      <p>
        Bulit in response to the USSR heavy tanks, it would quickly fall out of favor with the army, 
        due to being too fragile and troublesome. The remaining m103 would stay with marine corps 
        until hope ran out for a m60 replacements.

        The Sheridan had aluminum for the hull to be used for air droppable. It also had a gun 
        launcher system for the main armament, allowing it to lob large he rounds for direct fire 
        support for infantry, it replaced the m41. its biggest problem was its gun with heavy recoil 
        and short lifespan, the missile developed for it was produced but rarely used. It was 
        considered to been better if the gun was made to be a howitzer.
