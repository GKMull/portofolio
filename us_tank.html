      <h2> US Tanks</h2>
      <p>  
        The US before WWII didn’t really have tanks development due to lack luster perforce and 
        instead maintained one the largest cavalry in the world this shows in the lack of interest 
        of in the interwar period. Even the last US cavalry charge took place 
        in 1942 in the Philippines.

      <p>
        The Pershing was the only American heavy tank to see combat as other programs cancelled or 
        never made it to a war, but after WWII the Pershing was redesignated as a medium tank due to 
        changing standers of tanks, the reason that us never field any other heavy tanks is due to lack of 
        proper infrastructure only a handful of train cars and cranes could support the weight. So, when 
        this tanks rolled on to the battlefield it wasn’t just a sign tank development but the industrial 
        capability of the US.
