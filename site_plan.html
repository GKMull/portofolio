      <h3>Home page, What is a tank</h3>
      <p>
        [What is a tank, as the war in Ukraine rages on people have on the news and media have falsely 
        claimed that many different combat vehicles are tanks. But what is the cause of all this 
        confusion, one reason is because it looks like a tank combine with lack knowledge. Second, 
        people like to overvalue things by calling it a tank without caring about correct. Or giving special 
        terms to create interest from the public, to generate revenue.
      </p>
      <p>
        So how do we know what a tank is. A quick google give us a heavy armored fighting 
        vehicle carrying guns and moving on a continuous articulated metal track. It does. It does sound like the tank in your head, but it is too generic as (image to left) is a m3 tank while the (image to the right) is a m7 Howitzer Motor Carriage both fulfill the definition, but one is not a tank even though they share design DNA. So, what defines a tank. actually, it’s doctrine that defines what a tank is.
      </p>
      <p>
        While multiple countries have tanks, they also have different definitions and roles though out history. cruiser tanks in the UK would be light or medium tanks and vice versa for infantry tanks and assault tanks. It might seem like these things might seem miner, but definition and doctrine will create the expectation for what will it be and what, creating the variation between tanks though out history.
        But still there are some ways to define a tank.
        1.	Main Arment must a large caliber canon. Not howitzer (unless modified) or auto canon (fast fire guns would be a tankette)
      </p>
      <p>
        2.	Must be a full track vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.	Must have some level armor. Even light tanks should be able to withstand machine gun fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.	Must have a turret. Unless it is to fulfill all role to it counterpart (strv-103)
      </p>
      <p>
        5.	Was not made to carry infantry in to battle.
        While not perfect, these rules should allow you to quickly filter out any non-tanks.

      <h3>[United States tank history]</h3>
      <p>
        [	 
        The US before WWII didn’t really have tanks development due to lack luster perforce and 
        instead maintained one the largest cavalry in the world. There last US cavalry charge took place 
        in 1942 in the Philippines.
      </p>
      <p>
        1918 - 1919 M-1917 (license built 1917 French Renault) - 950 built 1918 - 19. armament 37mm 
        m 1916 canon or m1917 marlin later 1919 browning mg.
        First US tank, fail to make it to WWI. 
      </p>
      <p>
        1919 Mark 8 liberty tank – 125 built 1919-20. Armament 2 57mm 6 pounder cannon 5 .30 Cal mg
        Liberty comes from the engine name.
      </p>
      <p>
        1935
        M1 Combat car – 113 built. Armament 2 30. Cal machine gun 
        while deceptively name it is a tankette.
      </p>
      <p>
        M2 Light tank, - 989 built 1935 – 42. Armament 37mm cannon and 5 .30 Cal mg or 1 .50cal and. 30 cal Mgs.
        From twin turreted tankette to true tank this tank would be made from the lessons 
        learn from the Spanish civil war.
      </p>
      <p>
        1939 M2 Medium – 112 1939 armament 37mm cannon and 7 .30 Cals mg. 
        while a moving machine gun bunkers after the invasion of Poland production would cease to 
        make way some able to compete with the Germans tanks.
      </p>
      <p>
        1941 M3/M5 Stuart light – 22,744 1941-44 armament 37mm cannon, 2- 3 .30 Cals mgs
        The Stuart tanks were improved versions of the m2 light the m3 having thicker armor and m5 
        having improved redesigned front hull armor.
      </p>  
      <p>
        M3 lee medium 6,258 1941-42 armament 75mm, 37mm, 2-4 Cal .30 mgs. 
        This was a stop gap tank while the m4 was still in development combining any element might 
        deemed useful into one thing. This Frankenstein monster tank had a much longer production 
        because changing the line to m4 was not considered efficient enough.
      </p>
      <p>  
        1942 M4 Sherman medium 49,324 1942-45, armament 75-76 mm n or 105mm howitzer 2 .30 Cals 1 .50 Cal. 
        The Sherman was the universal tank, the jack of all trades master of none. It fought on all fronts. 
        One of the most produced tanks. With many different iterations. It stories of it development 
        exemplifies how America became a superpower in a few years.
      </p>
      <p>
        1943 M22 locust light 1943-44 830 built, armament 37 mm cannon, .30 Cal mg.
        Designed as an air deployable tank, it light armor made it obsolete before it rolled off 
        the production line. While not used by US force it was given to the British and used once in 
        Operation varsity.
      </p>
      <p>
        1944 M24 Chaffee Light 1944-45 4730 built, armament 75mm cannon, .50 Cal, .30 cal mg 
        The Chaffee while put into action late in WWII was still a mass upgrade compared to it’s Stuart 
        counter parts, But many units didn’t this tank till after the war. It best know for being in the 
        Korean war having to facing off enemy tanks with better armor and fire power.  
      </p>
      <p>
        M26 Pershing Heavy/Medium 2,202 1944-45 built, armament 90mm Cannon, 2 .30cal mg .50 cal mg
        The Pershing was the only American heavy tank to see combat as other programs cancelled or 
        never made it to a war, but after WWII the Pershing was redesignated as a medium tank due to 
        changing standers of tanks, the reason that us never field any other heavy tanks is due to lack of 
        proper infrastructure only a handful of train cars and cranes could support the weight. So, when 
        this tanks rolled on to the battlefield it wasn’t just a sign tank development but the industrial 
        capability of the US.
      </p>
      <p>
        1949 M46 Patton Medium 1,168 built 1949-51, armament 90mm Cannon 2 .30cal mg .50 cal mg.
        Bulit during the Korean war The M46 is a modernized M26 with most notably a new 800hp 
        engine. It was also the first American Main Battle tank (MBT), A new class of tank with more  
        powerful engines allow for bigger and heavier tanks without sacrificing mobility.
      </p>
      <p>
        1951 M41 Walker Bulldog light 5,467 built 1951-54, armament 76mm cannon, 1 .50 and 1 .30 cal mg
        With new munitions types the m41 was able to US light tanks to a modern fire power standard, and 
        Replacing any other light tanks by 1953
      </p>
      <p>
        1951 M47 Patton 8,576 built 1951-54, armament 90mm Cannon, .30cal mg, 2 .50 Cal mg.
        While made in large quantity to replace the problematic m46, it would never see service in 
        us use, beginning replaced by m48 and m103 tanks and retired 1959.
      </p>
      <p>
        1952 M48 Patton 11,703 built 1952-61, armament 90 - 105mm Cannon, .30cal mg, .50 Cal mg.
        M48 Patton would be the first us tank to use the current crew lay out Driver in the center 
        hull command seated behind the gunner on the right side and loader on the left with ammo behind 
        him. The m48 was chosen over the m47 due to the turret being wider allowing for more future 
        modification like 105mm L7 cannon that would be on the m60.
      </p>
      <p>
        1953 M103 Heavy Tank 300 built 1953-54 armament 120mm cannon 2 .30, cal, 1 50 cal mg.
        Bulit in response to the USSR heavy tanks, it would quickly fall out of favor with the army, 
        due to being too fragile and troublesome. The remaining m103 would stay with marine corps 
        until hope ran out for a m60 replacements.
      </p>
      <p>
        1959 M60 Medium Tank 15,000 built 1959-83 armament 105 mm L7 cannon, .50,.30 cal mg
        When first produced it had a m48 turret, few years later to the wedge turret giving much 
        better protection it was also the first tank to feature Era (Explosive Reactive armor)
      </p>
      <p>
        1966 M551 Sheridan light 1,662 built 1966-70 armament 152mm gun launcher, .50,.30 cal mg.
        The Sheridan had aluminum for the hull to be used for air droppable. It also had a gun 
        launcher system for the main armament, allowing it to lob large he rounds for direct fire 
        support for infantry, it replaced the m41. its biggest problem was its gun with heavy recoil 
        and short lifespan, the missile developed for it was produced but rarely used. It was 
        considered to been better if the gun was made to be a howitzer.
      </p>
      <p> 
        1979 M1 Abrams MBT 10,400 built 1979-92. Armament 105-120, .50,.30 cal mg
        Currently the only tank in US service features a 1500hp turbine jet engine with a .6 mpg.
         First built with a 105 cannon to be in step with the m60 but soon upgraded to a 120mm cannon 
         being the a1 variant. The M1 designation comes from being the first tank equipped with 
         composite armor in the US. The latest version is the is the M1A2 sep v3 with a v4 in the works.

        <h3>[The anatomy of a tank]</h3>
      <p>
        [The two main areas of the tank are the turret and the hull, which are subdivided to other major 
        components. in the hull including engine and gas, suspension, tracks, and additional ammo 
        storage while turret has the ready rack, mantle, cannon, and sights.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the back of the hull lies the engine if not the engine and transmission it would be additional
        ammo storage, in the past fuel tanks were in back but modern tanks it used as additional layer
        of armor around the tank while in the turret would be the ready rack ammo and the radio. 
      </p>
      <p>
        in the center of the tank is the turret ring the gears where turret rotates on. Inside of the ring is 
        the turret basket, it holds the gunner commander and loader keeping aligned with the turret. 
        Different tanks have different crew layouts but the 3 crew in the turret is the norm for NATO 
        tanks while 2 crew for Russian and other autoloader tanks. In old tank mostly German and 
        American, there may be a powertrain connecting the engine in back to the transition in front. 
      </p>
      <p> 
        On the bottom of the tank is the track, wheels, and suspension, for the wheel on the ground are 
        the road wheels they hold the weight, the gear looking wheel is the drive wheel it gives motion
        to the tank, on the opposite side of it is the idler wheel giving the track a constant shape 
        ground presser. And the return wheels keep the track up and out of the way. Suspension is a
        dependent (multiple wheels per suspension) or independent (single wheel suspension)
      </p>
      <p>
        In front before ammo being in front was put anywhere while in front hull gunner or assistant
        driver / hull gunner next to the driver instead of the ammo, the lower and upper plates of 
        armor is called upper and lower glacis respectively. The centered cannon (the best cannon 
        layout) next to it is often a co-axial machine gun. The moving part of the turret face around the
        cannon is the mantlet while the side of turret of the front are the cheeks. The sighting of a tank gunner’s next to the cannon in the mantlet or on top of the turret. The commanders is on top and can freely rotate.
