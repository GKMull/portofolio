        What is a tank, as the war in Ukraine rages on people have on the news and media have falsely 
         claimed that many different combat vehicles are tanks. But what is the cause of all this 
        confusion, one reason is because it looks like a tank combine with lack knowledge. Second, 
        people like to overvalue things by calling it a tank without caring about correct. Or giving special 
        terms to create interest from the public, to generate revenue.
        </p>
        <p>
        So how do we know what a tank is. A quick google give us a heavy armored fighting 
        vehicle carrying guns and moving on a continuous articulated metal track. It does. It does 
        sound like the tank in your head, but it is too generic as (image to left) is a m3 tank while the 
        (image to the right) is a m7 Howitzer Motor Carriage both fulfill the definition, but one is not a 
        tank even though they share design DNA. So, what defines a tank. actually, it’s doctrine that defines 
        what a tank is.

        <p>
        While multiple countries have tanks, they also have different definitions and roles though out history. 
        cruiser tanks in the UK would be light or medium tanks and vice versa for infantry tanks and assault tanks. 
        It might seem like these things might seem miner, but definition and doctrine will create the expectation for 
        what will it be and what, creating the variation between tanks though out history.
        But still there are some ways to define a tank.
        1.	Main Arment must a large caliber canon. Not howitzer (unless modified) or auto canon (fast fire guns would be a tankette)
          </p>
          <p>
            2.	Must be a full track vehicle.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.	Must have some level armor. Even light tanks should be able to withstand machine gun fire.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.	Must have a turret. Unless it is to fulfill all role to it counterpart (strv-103)
          </p>
          <p>
            5.	Was not made to carry infantry in to battle.
            While not perfect, these rules should allow you to quickly filter out any non-tanks.
